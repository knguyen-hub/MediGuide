## MediGuide

## Overvier

The idea for MediGuide came from seeing how difficult it can be, especially for older adults, to manage their medications. Many people struggle to remember when and how much to take, and the doctor’s instructions can be confusing. This often leads to missed doses or mistakes that can affect their health. We wanted to create something simple and stress-free to follow a medication plan so people can take the right medication at the right time without worry or confusion.

## Features
- **Visual Medication Guides**: Converts medical instructions into clear, step-by-step visuals, showing patients exactly what medicine to take, when, and how.
- **Web Interface**: The included `index.html` file provides a simple web interface for users to interact with the system.

## Dependencies
- Basic HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the frontend
- A future version may include additional server-side technologies like Flask or Node.js for integrating the doctor’s tool.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository and open the index.html file in your browser to explore the patient interface.
2. Customize the visual guides or other aspects by editing the front-end code.
3. (Coming Soon) Use the doctor's tool extension to generate patient medication instructions.

## Future Features
- **Doctor Extension**: Streamlined tools for healthcare professionals to provide customized medication guides during patient visits.
- **Notifications & Reminders**: Automatic alerts to help patients stay on track with their medication schedule.
- **Patient Progress Tracking**: Tracking adherence to the medication regimen and sharing the data with doctors.
